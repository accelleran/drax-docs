## Prepare and bring on air the Benetel 550 Radio

This section is exclusively applicable to the user/customer that intend to use the Benetel B550 Radio End with our Accellleran 5G end to end solution, if you do not have such radio end the informations included in this section may be misleading and bring to undefined error scenarios. Please contact Accelleran if your Radio End is not included in any section of this user guide.

Being Benetel B550 in all aspects similar if not identical to the B650 in its operating part, we prefer to avoid repeating the same content of the section dedicated to the B550 and we ask the Users to refer to that for operating the B550 as well.

there are however some main differences between the two Radio Ends that we want to highlight:

- B550 is an indoor unit, it is not water proof and has an integrated internal panel antenna enabled by default, but can swithced to external antennas if required or even be wired thanks to its output coax ports
- B550 requires a precise 1 PPS input signal or a PTP synchronisation signal in order to operate. Such signal shall be generated by appropriate synchronisation devices and trasfer via wired connection to a MINI Coax input port. The User must be aware of the difference between Coax and Mini Coax input as shown in the picture below

- B650 is an outdoor IP 67 waterproof device, 4x4 MIMO that requires external antennas to operate. As of today only two ports marked as Port 1 and Port 3 are operating and it is mandatory and necessary to connect those exits with appropriate antennas before operating the unit
- B650 need GPS signal to operate and complete the synchronisation phase and it will not operate unless this signal is made available

- Both component may be operated without synchronisation in the so called Freerun Mode (check also the Appendix A) however in such case Accelleran will not provide any support and it is defitely not worth evne trying the freerun mode if more than one Cell and/or more than one UEs are part of the deployment. The freerun mode is only useful for some quick sanity check in case the infrastructure to provide the synchronisation signal is not yet in place

#### Diagram

In the picture below we schematically show what will be run on the server by Docker and how the RRU is linked to the server itself: as mentioned early in this case the two components run by Docker are the L1 and the DU, while the RRU is supposedly served by a dedicated NIC Card capable of handling a 10 Gbps fiber link. If this is not your case please contact Accelleran for further information
